            In the year March, Finnigan dinkle wakes up, and is chosen as the alcoholic to defeat GrickleCorp, the teal-painted corporation producing mass quantities of the addictive, flammable, adhesive, hallucinogenic substance known as Grickle
            However, a small group of rebels has emerged, determined to overthrow the Council and bring freedom back to
            Ontario. These rebels are led by a charismatic figure named "Finnigan Dinkle" who is rumored to have supernatural
            abilities that make him almost invincible in combat. The player will take on the role of a skilled Combine
            soldier, who becomes disillusioned with their mission and joins the rebellion after witnessing the brutality of
            the GrickleCorp.

            their own unique skills and abilities. They will also uncover hidden secrets about Finnigan Dinkles past and the true
            nature of the Council's tyranny. With each victory, the player will gain new allies and resources, while the
            Ontario Guard becomes more formidable and relentless in their pursuit to crush the rebellion.
